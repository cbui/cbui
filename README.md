### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a staff software engineer at Venmo (PayPal) working on developer tooling and infrastructure.

I'm passionate about deployments and tooling for developers.

I write at [https://cbui.dev](https://cbui.dev)

In the past I've:

- Saved a company $500k a year in CI infrastructure costs.
- Worked with a several hundred engineer organization to migrate from Jenkins to GitHub Actions.
- Introduced configuration as code and GitOps best practices to teams.
- Built dynamic review environments triggered on pull request.

I'm available to:

- Reduce the costs of your CI infrastructure so that you can free up some of your infrastructure budget.
- Help you migrate from Jenkins to a more modern CI platform, like GitHub Actions to reduce operational overhead and iterate faster.
- Help your team evaluate emerging technologies and processes. CircleCI or GitHub Actions? Kubernetes or Nomad? GitOps or ChatOps? How do you know what's likely going to be a fad and what's not? I can help your team avoid costly mistakes when adopting new tools and processes.
- Scale your DevOps processes. Should your company adopt full stack teams that own the entire delivery pipeline or should a specialized team of internal experts own the pipelines? These are the questions I can help you answer so that you can decide on the right trade-offs that make sense for your company as it scales to avoid future expensive migrations.
- Do implementation work. Maybe you're a small team that doesn't have enough DevOps resources. I can augment your team, dive in, and start delivering fast. I'm well-versed in terraform, kubernetes, docker, etc. I can help you build repeatable pipelines, documentation, and provide a smooth hand-off to your internal team.
- Need something else? Please don't hestiate to reach out.
