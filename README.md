### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about deployments and tooling for developers.

Staff engineer at Flex (getflex.com) leading DevOps and Infra. 

Former staff software engineer at Venmo (PayPal) working on developer tools and infra (CI). I led Venmo's migration from Jenkins to GitHub Actions.

I write at [https://cbui.dev](https://cbui.dev)

In the past I've:

- Saved a company $500k a year in CI infrastructure costs.
- Worked with a several hundred engineer organization to migrate from Jenkins to GitHub Actions.
- Introduced configuration as code and GitOps best practices to teams.
- Built dynamic review environments triggered on pull request.
